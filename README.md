Hi!

I present some project to order dishes.
It componed in React using Redux and React-Router.
Dishes is selected in "selectPage" and stored in local "useState". After approval are stored in Redux store, and displayed to finally confirm in "confirmPage". In case of succes data is fetching to server (i tested in local json-server). 
Finally displaing information of succes and stored sent order / or showing occuring error's.

Greetings. ;)
